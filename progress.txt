What do I want to achieve?
 Create a knowledge graph with search capabilities? So that I don't have to write text files in here?  



[ ] Milestone 1: Duplicate Cymbolism functionality (edit text file with nested items, show\hide)
  [y] Show a static file
    [y] Move cursor left\right 
  [y] Figure out what to do with Windows \r symbols
  [y] Remove chars
  [y] Insert chars
  [ ] Tab size using tab (2 for yafe 4 for C)
  [ ] Scroll screen
  [ ] Save\load file
  [ ] Migrate editor from the old system 
  [ ] Close\hide subnodes
  [ ] Vimlike navigation in the project
  [ ] Undo\redo history
  [ ] Search history
  [ ] Text wrap

[ ] Backbuffer
  [ ] File picker
  [ ] Split screen
  [ ] Multiple cursors
  [ ] Colors

[ ] Problems
  [ ] I can't use the same cursor for SegoeUI and Consolas fonts. Non-monospaced fonts do not allow Vim-like cursor (it looks ugly because widths of chars are different).
  [ ] Up\down navigation with left\right jumps might be confusing. I need to figure out how I can best solve this. Mimic VSCode as close as possible
